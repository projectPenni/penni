/**
 * The 7-1 architecture pattern is adopted from Hugo Giraudel and the Sass Guidelines
 * Hugo Giraudel's Sass Boilerplate: https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate
 * Sass Architecture Guidelines: http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture
 *
 * By using SCSS as a meta-language and CSS preprocessor, we simplify our CSS by
 * introducing variables, mixins, functions, etc. SCSS allows the developer to
 * easily maintain DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") code making maintenance faster
 * and more efficient.
 *
 * SCSS rather than Sass is used throughout The Gazelle because of its syntactic
 * similiarity to CSS. For a SCSS syntax guide, visit http://sass-lang.com/guide.
 *
 * We follow the BEM naming conventions for futher clarity. For specifics,
 * visit http://getbem.com/naming/.
