# Watson Design Guide [![Circle CI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/IBM-Watson/design-library/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/IBM-Watson/design-library/tree/develop)


## Getting Started

Development on the Watson Design Guide is done in this repository. Patterns are developed in the `patterns/` folder, with enhancements to the guides done in `guides/` and enhancements to the site itself done in the `site/` folder. The design guide runs off of the [Watson Runner](https://github.com/IBM-Watson/runner), so work on that should be done there.

## Working with the Design Guide

Development is done through Node. Please refer to the [Developing for the Design Guide](https://github.com/IBM-Watson/design-library/wiki/Developing-for-the-Design-Guide) wiki article for how to get started and how to work on the Design Guide.
