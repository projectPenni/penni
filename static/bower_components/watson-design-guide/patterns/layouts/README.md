# Layouts

Layouts are a way of arranging components on a page. Layouts should respond to the viewport and should be small enough to cover only what's absolutely necessary for that layout (*e.g.* a layout for an article shouldn't include a page's header or footer layouts, it should just be a layout for an article).
