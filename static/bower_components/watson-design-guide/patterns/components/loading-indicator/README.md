## SVG Animations
SVG and Gif fallback animations are housed in the `images` folder.

- All of the animation is stored in the SVG file. There are 2 types of animations in the SVG file:
  - `SMIL`- Animates the smaller elements, like strokes and dots animating 
  - `CSS` - Animates the larger elements, like scaling the entire SVG
