title: Base Elements
---

Base elements are HTML tags without additional specificity (*e.g.* `a` and `h1`, not `.link` or `.header`) and root level pseudo-elements (*e.g.* `::selection`, `::root`), as well as any custom CSS resetting (*e.g.* making images fluid, setting `box-sizing: border-box` for all elements). A combination of elements is used to create larger components and layouts.
