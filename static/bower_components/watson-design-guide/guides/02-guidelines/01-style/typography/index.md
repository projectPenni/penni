Typography is the atomic element of good interface design. It colors the words in our language and shapes their meaning. It helps to set the visual tone for the entire IBM Watson experience. Text is largely differentiated by size and weight. Keep other properties the same or similar, differentiating only when necessary for the sake of clarity.

## Helvetica Neue for IBM

As a rule and wherever possible, use Helvetica Neue. It is the font of science and the information age, with a precision and objectivity that commands respect. We lean on Helvetica Neue to do the hard work of conveying information, specifications, and the basics. Its clean confidence makes it ideal for our product design.

## Performance Considerations

When presenting large amounts of content, it is important to consider how multiple font downloads can affect the [browserâ€™s performance](/guidelines/user-experience/performance/) for the user. To ensure optimized performance for all users, IBM Watson recommends choosing a combination of no more than four different weights and styles (light and light oblique being two different styles, for instance).

## Typographic Scale

The IBM Design Language recommends using [modular type scales](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/visual/typography.shtml) to create harmonious proportions and structure. Scale creates consistent sizing across elements. A visual type scale turns a typographic balancing act into a set ratio. 

### Major Third Type Scale

IBM Watson recommends the Major Third ratio for screen sizes under 500px and the establishment of breakpoints for higher contrast on larger screens. This ratio is ideal for creating visual hierarchy on small screens without being too jarring.
