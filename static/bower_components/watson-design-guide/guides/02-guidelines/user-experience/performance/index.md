Performance is an integral part of a user's experience no matter the medium that interface takes. Web-delivered interfaces, native interfaces, application programming interfaces; whenever a user interacts with a product, performance always needs to be a top concern. Slow performing interfaces have been shown to [cost money and conversions](http://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales) and [affect a company's bottom line](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/). More than that, performance is about respecting our users and the way humans perceive and react to the world around them.

## The Neuroscience of Performance

In Jakob Nielsen's book _Usability Engineering_, he [describes three important limits in human response time](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/):

> * **0.1 second** is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is **reacting instantaneously**, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.
>* **1.0 second** is about the limit for the **user's flow of thought** to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.
> * **10 seconds** is about the limit for **keeping the user's attention** focused on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish, so they should be given feedback indicating when the computer expects to be done. Feedback during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely to be highly variable, since users will then not know what to expect.

This research, published in 1993, has since been expanded upon with [Powers of 10: Time Scales in User Experiences](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux/) which goes in to more detail about the importance of time in the user's perception of an experience. Beyond Nielsen, additional research suggests that the 10 second maximum in practice winds up being closer to **5 seconds** for many people, with [50% of mobile users exiting an application or site if it takes more than 5 seconds to load](http://e-commercefacts.com/research/2011/07/what-usrs-want-from-mobil/19986_WhatMobileUsersWant_Wp.pdf). In 2010, CA Technologies commissioned a study to [quantify how humans react to slow websites](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2011/02/24/website-performance-web-stress/). This reaction, called *web stress*, showed that "…participants had to concentrate up to 50% more when using badly performing websites" and that they had "…greater agitation and stress" when using slow websites. The reason for this web stress is mainly because the limits of human short-term memory [are pretty bad](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/). There are three parts of memory that humans use at any given time (not including long-term memory) that have direct effects on how we perceive performance: sensory memory, short-term memory, and working memory.

[Sensory memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_memory) is the most basic input from an organism's senses. For humans, these inputs are sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. They retain impressions of sensory information after the original stimulation has ceased, stored just long enough to be transfered to short-term memory. It has been experimentally shown that the duration of visual sensory memory (*iconic memory*) is between **100ms-200ms**, meaning that if an interface is able to react to a user's input and respond to them in **<100ms**, the reaction will be perceived as a seamless continuation of the interaction. Anything longer and our memory will reset with whatever the current stimuli is, risking an interruption in the perception of an interface by the user.

[Short-term memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory) is the capacity of holding small amount of information in an active, readily available state. It is commonly cited to only be able to hold [7 ± 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two) chunks of information at a time and each chunk only lasts around 18 seconds. If more information is entered in to the short-term memory in that time, retrieval of information stored earlier becomes error-prone. 

[Working memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory) is the system responsible for holding and processing new and already stored information. Short-term memory and working memory work together to store, comprehend, process, and update all information coming in from sensory memory as well as keep current tasks and thoughts close at hand. Working memory's capacity has been hard to pin down exactly, but the two most prominent models, when taken together, suggest that the more information that must be maintained in working memory, the slower and more error-prone concurrent processes become. The rate of decay of working memory is based on the temporal density and attentional demands of the processing task (this is also known as *cognitive load*).

### The Size and Speed of Immersion

Sensory memory, short-term memory, and working memory combine to determine how immersive an interface feels to a user. The faster an interface is able to respond to a user, the faster that user's sensory memory can pick up the response, the faster that response can be stored in short-term memory, and the faster that working memory can start processing the result in context of the input. The longer that initial step takes, or the larger the amount being asked for and retrieved, the more likely that a user's memory for the task at hand will decay. This decay is what causes web stress and leads users abandon tasks and sites entirely.

## Notifying Users About Interface Delays

Based on this understanding of memory as well as Nielsen's research, we recommend notifying users about the duration of tasks in the following ways:

* **<=100ms** - If a response takes 100ms or less, no notification is needed
* **>100ms** - If a response takes more than 100ms, an indication that a user's response is being processed should be provided. This is commonly a loading indicator or (ideally) a progress bar showing percent complete
* **>3s** - If a response takes more than 3s, the task should be backgrounded, giving the user the ability to subscribe to updates for when the task completes. Backgrounded tasks should include context of the original request in order to help the user recall the reason the request was made.

## Creating Smooth Interfaces

A human's sensory memory, acting at 100ms, is able to identify around 10 unique images per second. In order to create the illusion of smooth movement for users, as opposed to a series of independent images, more images are needed. The number of images per second, or frame rate, is often expressed as either Frames per Second (FPS), or in hertz (Hz) when working with progressive scan monitors. For a point of reference, the *de facto* standard for movies and television with sound is 24 FPS.

{{ _example.large(examples.framesPerSecond) }}

When creating interfaces, however, 24 FPS will not provide the fluid movement it does on film. Film relies on a number of effects—most commonly, [motion blur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur)—to hide inter-frame judder. When [animating interface elements](/guidelines/interaction/animation/) or having users interact with our interfaces in a way that would cause motion, such as scrolling, we cannot rely upon those same effects because they are unique to the film medium. Instead, our interfaces should update at the same rate the device's screen is refreshing. When interfaces are not able to refresh at this rate, the result, called [Jank](http://jankfree.org/), is a "…stuttering, juddering, or just plain halting" of the interface.

Most devices today have a **refresh rate of 60Hz**, so that is what we should aim our interfaces to refresh at.

## Grading and Measuring Performance

Whenever working with a network powered interface (websites, native apps that make network calls, cross-network APIs, etc…), the following measurements should be performed and graded against in order to inform if an interface is performing at the level expected:

* Main content is available and usable in **<1s** on a **5/1 Mbps connection with a 28ms round trip time** on a *cold cache*
* Main content is available and usable in **<3s** on a **1.6 Mbps/768 Kbps connection with a 300ms round trip time** on a *cold cache*

When working with visual interfaces, the [speed index](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index) metric is also a good indicator of how quickly an interface is available and usable.

* A speed index of **<1000** on a **5/1 Mbps connection with a 28ms round trip time** on a *cold cache*
* A speed index of **<3000** on a **1.6 Mbps/768 Kbps connection with a 300ms round trip time** on a *cold cache*

{{ _example.large(examples.desktopLoad) }}

{{ _example.large(examples.mobileLoad) }}

All interfaces should be tested against both. [Web Page Test](http://www.webpagetest.org/) is a tool that will allow teams to test their website performance metrics against these numbers.
